		<h1>What is a Sacrament?</h1>

			<div class="fx_2">
				<p class="action">A sacrament is a means which God uses to show His grace and help us achieve salvation. The word sacrament means “a sign of the sacred,” which is fitting as they are all outwards signs from God to us. Not only are they signs, they’re also celebrations of a continued journey and relationship with God, teachings to help live out His word and ceremonies to show devotion to Him.</p>
				<h2>Where did the sacraments originate?</h2>
				<p>In the Bible, Christ gives his followers clear instructions on how to administer and receive each of the sacraments. This is seen through his work with the Apostles, healing the sick, parables, giving his body and blood to nourish our souls and forgiving sinners. The Church administers these holy sacraments as instructed, in order for all to worship God and receive His salvation.</p>

				<h3>The Sacraments of Initiation</h3>
				<p>The three sacraments of initiation are <strong>Baptism</strong>, <strong>Confirmation</strong> and <strong>Eucharist</strong>. Each is meant to strengthen your faith and forge a deeper relationship with God. Baptism frees you from original sin, confirmation strengthens your faith and Eucharist allows you to taste the body and blood of eternal life and be reminded of Christ’s love and sacrifice.</p>

				<h3>The Sacraments of Healing</h3>
				<p>The two sacraments of healing are <strong>Penance or Confession</strong> and <strong>Anointing the Sick</strong>. Penance allows for spiritual healing and absolution for people who have distanced themselves from God through sin. Anointing the sick allows for both physical and spiritual healing. When one falls seriously ill, a minister anoints them and prays over them, calling on Christ to strengthen and heal.</p>
