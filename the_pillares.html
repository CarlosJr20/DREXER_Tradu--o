		<h2>Consecration to Jesus Through Mary</h2>
		<div class="flex">
			<div class="fx_2">
				<p>Mary is the easiest, shortest and most perfect path to Jesus Christ. She is the path opened by Jesus Christ when he came to us and in which there are no obstacles to reach Him. By opening her life to us, Mary shows that we need not be afraid to give ourselves wholly to Christ. She helps us understand the work of the Spirit and to joyfully cooperate with it. Mary is there with us when we are asked to stand with Christ at Calvary, and she helps us to persevere with faith until the Resurrection comes.</p>

		<h2>Stewardship</h2>
		<div class="flex">
			<div class="fx_2">
				<p>“<em>Amen, I say to you, this poor widow has put in more than all those who have been putting money into the treasury. For they all have put in out of their abundance; but she out of her poverty has put in all that she had.</em>” — Mk 12:44</p>
				<p>Stewardship, in its simplest terms, is the act of putting God’s priorities before our own. Good stewards give the first portion of their gifts of time, talent and treasure to the Lord’s work, in gratitude for his many blessings. This practice of giving our first fruits incorporates the aspect of sacrificial giving.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="fx_2">
				<blockquote>
					<p class="action">Let us make a regular and consistent sacrificial offering for the work of the parish through the weekly offering and for the work of the Archdiocese through the annual ABCD.</p>
