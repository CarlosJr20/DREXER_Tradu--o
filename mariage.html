Welcome: 
<h2>We welcome you to St. Katharine Catholic Church!</h2>
	<p>We are glad that you have selected our church to celebrate the Sacrament of Matrimony. Though many couples decide to celebrate their wedding day with us, each wedding is unique and important. We will make every effort in helping you to prepare for this Sacrament, an important spiritual moment, one which will take you to the very presence of God. We anticipate that when the couples leave the church building on their wedding day, they will feel that their wedding ceremony was very personal, inspiring, and spiritual. Above all, we hope that when you leave the church building you will be well prepared for your new life as husband and wife.</p>
	<p>We strive to work with each couple on an individual basis. We shall work with you in preparing all the necessary documentation and involving you in our marriage preparation programs so that you might be well prepared for your wedding day and throughout your married life together.</p>

Preparation:

    <blockquote class="max-width">
        <p>The Archdiocese of Miami, vigilant about the seriousness of entering into a lifelong un- ion, has structure a <strong>six-step process</strong> of preparation that leads to marriage.</p>
        <p>The bride and the groom must be at least 19 years old by the wedding date.</p>
        <p>The process of wedding preparation takes at least six months.</p>
    </blockquote>
    
    <h2>Step 1: Contact the Parish</h2>
    <p>After you become engaged, and in order to set a wedding date, the Parish must first determine if you and your fiancé(e) are free to marry.</p>
    <p>During this first step, the Initial Wedding Application will be submitted, along with all necessary certificates and documents that are unique to your individual situation.</p>
    <p>The initial deposit will also be collected and a wedding date will be selected and reserved.</p>
    <p>Weddings are celebrated:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Saturdays at 2:00pm</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="separator"></div>
    
    <h2>Step 2: Fully Engaged Assessment</h2>
    <p>You will be assisted by a married couple from the parish who will journey with you throughout your preparation for marriage.</p>
    <p>You will complete a premarital inventory, comprised of a series of questions designed to assess each of your habits, expectations, and values. It will provide you with a personalized profile of your relationship’s strengths and weaknesses. This inventory is an important starting point for couple discussion and helps to identify any areas in the relationship that may need attention.</p>
    <div class="separator"></div>
    
    
    <h2>Step 3: Marriage Preparation</h2>
    The Archdiocese of Miami offers a variety of programs, in English and Spanish, to prepare you for the Sacrament of Marriage. To register for one of these courses, please visit: <a href="https://www.miamiarch.org/familylife" target="_blank">www.miamiarch.org/familylife</a>.
    <div class="separator"></div>
    
    <h2>Step 4: Natural Family Planning</h2>
    <p>To ensure you have the tools to plan your family effectively and in accord with God’s plan for marriage, you will have the opportunity to learn about Natural Family Planning (NFP).</p>
    <p>The Archdiocese has instructors available in a variety of NFP Methods. For more information, please visit: <a href="https://www.miamiarch.org/familylife" target="_blank">www.miamiarch.org/familylife</a>.</p>
    
    <h2>Step 5: Receive the Sacrament of Reconciliation</h2>
    <p>The Church invites all Catholics to prepare spiritually prior to the mar- riage by celebrating the Sacrament of Reconciliation. This should be done as often as possible throughout the preparation period.</p>
    
    <h2>Step 6: Meet with your Priest</h2>
    <p>Before celebrating your marriage, each couple is invited to meet with the priest who will be presiding your wedding liturgy.</p>
    <div class="separator"></div>
    
    <blockquote>
        <h1>How do our parents fit into our parish wedding preparations?</h1>
        <p>From the very beginning and throughout your entire wedding preparation, we communicate only with the bride and groom.</p> 
        <p>While we acknowledge, understand, comprehend, support their interest in the marriage ceremony of their son or daughter, should parents (or any other relative or friend) contact us regarding your marriage plans, we shall immediately thank them for their interest and refer them back to you, the couple. The bride and the groom together are the only persons who communicate decisions to us.</p>
    </blockquote>
    
    
    Documentation:

    <p>Once you have read the full guidelines, please download, fill out and submit the “<a href="http://skdrexel.atimo.us/ctm/31297/projects/skdrexel/gallery/2022/09/SKDrexel_Marriage_Form.pdf" target="_blank">Initial Wedding Application</a>” and start gathering all necessary documentation:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Updated Baptismal Certificates</li>
	<li>Certificates of First Holy Communion</li>
	<li>Certificates of Confirmation</li>
	<li>(If Applicable) Final Divorce Orders and/or Decrees of Nullity</li>
	<li>Couple & Witness Forms (“A and B Forms”)</li>
	<li>Marriage License (Obtained within 30 days or your finalized wedding date)</li>
</ul>

<h2>What about a previous marriage?</h2>
<p>Some couples come to us with a history of a prior marriage. If you were previously married, before you can select a tentative wedding date, you will need to bring the following documents:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A copy of your prior civil marriage license certificate.</li>
	<li>A copy of your final civil divorce decree.</li>
	<li>If you obtained an annulment the original annulment decree issued by a church marriage tribunal must be submitted.</li>
</ul>
<p>If a couple needs to begin an annulment process, please know that no wedding date can be set, even tentatively, until the annulment process is fully resolved.</p>
<p>In the event that there is a civil marriage and divorce we will submit proper canonical lack of form documentation to the Tribunal of the Archdiocese of Miami. Please be completely honest in this regard. If the issue of a prior marriage should arise later, the scheduled wedding date cannot be honored.</p>
<div class="separator"></div>

<h2>What are the “A” and “B” Forms?</h2>
<p>The “A” and “B” Forms establish your canonical freedom to marry within the Catholic Church. You will ask two witnesses to go before a notary public and testify to your freedom to marry (the “B” Forms).</p>
<p>The two witnesses for the bride and the groom often are the parents, brothers, sisters, aunts, or cousins; in total you will have four “B” Forms, two for the bride and two for the groom. As these forms establish your canonical freedom to marry and no wedding can take place without them, please be certain that they are completed within the first two months of your preparation period.</p>

		<h3>We are in the Holy Presence of God</h3>
		<p>St. Katharine Drexel Catholic Church strives that all wedding liturgies provide a holy, spiritual, and personal experience for the bride, groom, and guests. We wish for them to feel welcome and longing to return again to worship with us. To create this atmosphere and to maintain a sense of respect for the Eucharist, we show a sense of reverence, silence, and proper decorum within the church.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="index_this">
		<h3>Wedding dress code for the bride and bridesmaids</h3>
		<p>We wish our brides and their bridesmaids to exercise great care and prudence in selecting their wedding dress. Please recall that you are entering the Sacrament of Matrimony before Almighty God, the priest or deacon, your family and friends. Select dresses that are dignified and beautiful.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="index_this">
		<h3>Flower Girl and Ring Bearer</h3>
		<p>We kindly request that if you decide to have a Flower Girl and/or Ring Bearer you exercise great caution in selecting these little ones. We ask that the two children selected be five years or older, and behave accordingly in church.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="index_this">
		<h3>The Wedding Procession</h3>
		<p>The bridal court will consist of the following; maid of honor, best man, six (6) bridesmaids, and a maximum of six (6) groomsmen. You may very well decide to have less or simply consider not having a bridal court at all. Additionally, you may ask the bride’s mother and groom’s mother to enter prior to the bridal court’s procession.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="index_this">
		<h3>Church Decorations</h3>
		<p>You may wish to place two simple flower arrangements on the sanctuary. The florist agreement form outlines the specific places where these flower arrangements may be placed.</p>
		<p>Flowers may not be utilized during the sacred holy season of Lent. However, the bride and her bridal court may carry flowers while entering and exiting the church, as well as the groomsmen may wear boutonnieres. The Groom’s and Bride’s mothers may also wear corsages.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="index_this">
		<h3>Who may officiate or preside at the wedding liturgy?</h3>
		<p>Generally one of our parish priests will preside at your wedding ceremony. One will be assigned to your wedding, thus you will have time to meet before the wedding date. If you wish to have a family member or personal friend who is a Roman Catholic priest or deacon, please let us know and we will guide you, and most importantly the presider/celebrant in obtaining proper canonical delegation from the Pastor at St. Katharine Drexel Catholic Church. The priest or deacon to whom the delegation is granted must observe every guideline and all liturgical rubrics established by the Roman Catholic Church.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="index_this">
		<h3>Wedding Rehearsals</h3>
		<p>Wedding rehearsals are assigned Friday before the wedding date.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="index_this">
		<h3>Arrive on time on your wedding day</h3>
		<p>Our weddings are well planned, well-rehearsed, and scheduled with sufficient time; therefore, the wedding party, parents, bride and invited guests must arrive on time for the wedding ceremony. All wedding ceremonies begin and end with ample time. Please realize that we may very well have multiple sacramental celebrations in church on a given day. Please read the Timeliness Agreement carefully. Important: Every wedding ceremony is assigned one hour and 15 minutes; this includes, the wedding ceremony itself followed by the photo session.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="index_this">
		<h3>Signing of documents after the ceremony</h3>
		<p>Immediately after the ceremony, two witnesses will be asked to sign the church marriage certificate and/or the civil marriage license. The priest or deacon will sign the marriage license as well.</p>

	<div class="index_this">
		<h3>During the Liturgy</h3>
		<p>The photographer may take pictures as the bride and her wedding party enter and leave the main aisle by standing by the back pews or in the middle of the church. During the ceremony, the photographer may take pictures with a remote or long lens camera from the same two places but may not use flash. Once the ceremony begins, the photographer may step into the main aisle at the back and remain there for the entire ceremony. Photographers may not walk anywhere else and especially never up and down the main aisle.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="index_this">
		<h3>Following the Ceremony</h3>

	</div>
	<div class="index_this">
		<h3>Respect for the Sacred</h3>
		<p>Family and guests may not take any photographs during any portion of the ceremony.

		<h3>Music for Weddings in the Roman Catholic Church</h3>

Sacred music is always the proper setting for the Wedding Liturgy. All music should be selected from the list of musical works provided by St. Katharine Drexel Catholic Church.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="index_this">
		<h3>Liturgical Planning Session</h3>
		<p>All couples getting married at St. Katharine’s are required to coordinate their wedding music with the Director of Music Ministries. Couples will have the opportunity to hear musical selections both instrumental and sung, and make their selections for their wedding.

	</div>
	<div class="index_this">
		<h3>Musicians/Cantors</h3>
		<p>It is the policy at St. Katharine Drexel Catholic Church that only parish musicians must be utilized for all Wedding Liturgies. A soloist/cantor and pianist will be selected from the pool of parish musicians. A parish musician from another Archdiocese of Miami parish is also acceptable. Although it is discouraged that outside musicians perform at weddings, an exception may be made only with the written approval of the Director of Music Ministries for only one musician/singer.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="index_this">
		<h3>Mass Parts</h3>
