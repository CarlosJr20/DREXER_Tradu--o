			<p>There are different kinds of spiritual gifts but the same Spirit; there are different forms of service but the same Lord; there are different workings but the same God who produces all of them in everyone. To each individual the manifestation of the Spirit is given for some benefit. But one and the same Spirit produces all of these individually to each person as he wishes.</p>

				<p>We believe that in giving of ourselves and using the spiritual gifts that God has given us, we can make a difference in the world. Spiritual gifts are the talents, skills and abilities that are given by God so that we can be an active part of bringing His Kingdom to earth.</p>

				<p class="action">There are many opportunities to participate in the active ministries in our parish. Carefully consider how you might use the gifts that God has given to you and choose at least one ministry where you can contribute.</p>
