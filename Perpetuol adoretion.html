				<p>Your Holy Hour is spent in adoration, a form of prayer, centered on the Eucharist, the Body and Blood of Jesus through the process of transubstantiation. The essence of what we are seeing, by the power of God, has changed. The Eucharist is displayed in a special holder called the monstrance.</p>
				<p>The Catechism of the Catholic Church tells us that, “Adoration is the first attitude of man acknowledging that he is a creature, before his Creator. It exalts the greatness of the Lord who made us and the almighty power of the Savior who sets us free from evil. Adoration is homage of the spirit to the “King of Glory,” respectful silence in the presence of the “ever greater” God.</p>
				<p class="action">Adoration of the thrice-holy and sovereign God of love blends with humility and gives assurance to our supplications. (CCC 2628)</p>
