Belive:

<p>Baptism is the port of entry into a life of faith in Jesus Christ, which finds expression in being a member of His Mystical Body, the Church, concretely lived out in an active sacramental life of faith at a parish.</p>
<p>Baptism has its unique benefits and responsibilities. Through sacramental signs, Baptism brings the seeds of divine life into the very soul of the child, making the young one into a child of God and a vessel of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>Baptism confers great dignity upon the child, illumining the young one with grace and spiritual light for the journey ahead.</p>
<p>As such, the celebration of Baptism is a moment of great joy for the parents as they see the promises of Christ and the hope of eternity dawn on their child.</p>
<p>It is also a day of great joy for the Church as the words of Christ are fulfilled right before our eyes. The Risen Christ once said, “<em>Go, therefore, and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.</em>”</p>
<p>The ritual of Baptism makes reality this great commission of our Blessed Lord. It thus also becomes a day of great joy for our parish family as we see Christ acting among us, enabling our parish community to grow in number.</p>


Preparation:

<p>In order to enable the parents to carry out the proper preparation, we require a period of <strong>at least two months</strong>, consisting of the following:</p>

<h2>Active Participation at St. Katharine Drexel Catholic Church</h2>
<p>The Church of Baptism is the church where all subsequent Sacraments are recorded. The Church of Baptism is then the “home” church for the person who is being Baptized and is part of the life of the person from then on. As a rule, an adult is to be baptized in his or her proper parish church and an infant in the proper parish church of the parents (CC 857 §2). The expectation of the church is that the Church of Baptism is where the family is actively participating in the faith.</p>
<p>Parishioners of SKDCC should be registered with the parish and actively participating in the life of the parish community. Welcome Packages are available at the Parish Office and at the main entrances of the church and all registration details can also be found on our parish website.</p>

<h2>Required Documentation</h2>
<ol class="flex">
	<li class="fx_2">Completed <a href="http://skdrexel.atimo.us/ctm/31297/projects/skdrexel/gallery/2022/09/SKDrexel_Baptism_Form.pdf" target="_blank">Baptism Registration Form</a>.</li>
	<li class="fx_2">Copy of the Birth Certificate of the child to be baptized.</li>
	<li class="fx_2">Certificate of Attendance of the Pre-Baptismal Class for both parents and Godparents.</li>
	<li class="fx_2">If not registered at SKDCC, a letter of permission from the parents’ home parish.</li>
	<li class="fx_2">Sponsor’s Certificate of Confirmation.</li>
	<li class="fx_2">Sponsor’s Certificate of Catholic Marriage (if applicable).</li>
	<li class="fx_2">Sponsorship Letter from Sponsor’s home parish, attesting that they are registered, active parishioners, participating in the life of the parish community.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
	<h1>Pre-Baptismal Preparation Class</h1>
	<p>Parents and Godparents must participate in the Pre-Baptismal Preparation Class.</p>
	<p>The 3 hour bilingual class is offered here at St. Katharine Drexel Catholic Church on the third Saturday of each month by Zoom.</p>
	<p>The class can alternatively be taken at any Catholic parish. Self-Guided Online Baptism preparation courses, however, are not currently accepted. In the very rare case that classes are not offered at your church, or at any neighboring parish by you, you can request to have a one-on-one appointment with a priest.</p>
</blockquote>

Godparents:

<p>To be chosen as a godparent is a special honor. You, above all others, have been entrusted with the responsibility to participate in this child’s Christian life and education. This privilege offers you the opportunity to develop a mutually enriching spiritual relationship that will last throughout this life and beyond.</p>

<p>It is the very ancient custom of the Church that at the celebration of the sacrament of baptism or confirmation, a Godparent be present.</p>

<div class="separator"></div>

<h3>The functions of the Godparent/Sponsor are:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Together with the celebrant who baptizes or confirms, to represent the Church in receiving the person into the communion of the Church;</li>
	<li>To assist the person in Christian initiation.</li>
</ul>

<div class="separator"></div>

<h3>In accord with Canon 874 of the Code of Canon Law, the Church can admit a person to the role of Godparent/Sponsor if:</h3>
<ul class="flex">
	<li class="fx_2">He or she is not less than sixteen years of age; and</li>
	<li class="fx_2">Has been confirmed and has already received the blessed Eucharist.</li>
	<li class="fx_2">Lives a life of faith which befits the role to be undertaken, and</li>
	<li class="fx_2">Is not either the father or the mother of the person.</li>
</ul>

<p>At least one of the Godparents/Sponsors must be an active, registered parishioner in good standing with a Catholic parish. Given the functions and role a Godparent/ Sponsor exercises, a non-Catholic Christian cannot be admitted as a Godparent/Sponsor; however, he or she can serve as  a witness of honor. A non-Christian cannot serve in this latter capacity, but is welcome to be present at the ceremony.</p>

<p>The Catholic seeking to be admitted as a Godparent/Sponsor must “live a life of faith which befits the role to be undertaken.”</p>

<div class="separator"></div>

<h3>Therefore, Godparents/Sponsors must:</h3>
<ul class="flex">
	<li class="fx_2">Sincerely believe and strive to put into practice the Word of God as taught by the Catholic Church;</li>
	<li class="fx_2">Regularly take part in the Mass on Sundays and Holy Days of Obligation.</li>
	<li class="fx_2">Godparents/Sponsors from other parishes must bring Sponsor letters stating that they are active registered parishioners in good standing of that parish.</li>
	<li class="fx_2">If two Godparents/Sponsors are to be selected, there is to be only one male and one female Godparent/Sponsor. Alternatively, you can have only one Godparent/Sponsor, if you so desire.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
	<h1>Proxies</h1>
	<p>In the event that a godparent cannot be present for the Celebration of the Baptism, the godparent may be represented by a proxy. The proxy must meet the same requirements of the godparent. When a proxy is used, the godparent needs to provide a letter designating the proxy by name.</p>
</blockquote>


Ceremonies:

<p>For the convenience and needs of our many families here at St. Katharine Drexel Catholic Church, we offer private Baptismal ceremonies, as well as group Baptismal ceremonies.</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Private Baptisms</strong><br>Celebrated on the first and second Saturdays of the month at 10:00am, 10:45am, 11:30am, and 12:15pm.</li>
	<li><strong>Group Baptisms</strong><br>Celebrated in Spanish on the first Sunday of the month at 3:30pm, and in English on the second Sunday of the month at 3:30pm.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
	<p>The date of the Baptism cannot be reserved until all requirements have been met and all documents have been received.</p>
</blockquote>
	
<h2>Offering</h2>
<p>Sacraments in the Catholic Church are always freely offered. However, given the real costs of personnel, supplies, and the preparation of the church, donations are requested in the amount of:</p>
<ul>
	<li>$200 for Private Baptism.</li>
	<li>Donation at your discretion for Group Baptism.</li>
</ul>


Etiquette:

<h2>Dress</h2>
<p>While there is no specific dress code for those attending the baptism, modest conservative wear is suggested. It is always appropriate and welcome for gentlemen to wear a suit and tie and for ladies to wear semi-casual clothes. Business casual attire or its equivalent is just as appropriate, especially in South Florida.</p>
 
<h2>Decorum</h2>
<div class="text-column2">
	<p>Due to the sacredness of the liturgy, it must reflect a respectful and reverent atmosphere at all times. Therefore, it is prohibited to talk or text on cell phones or other devices while inside the church and during the liturgy. Devices should be silenced upon entering the church.</p>
	<p>It is not permitted to eat, drink, chew gum, smoke or use vaping pens inside the church. Should the need arise for someone to engage in any of these activities, we kindly ask that they quietly step outside the church, so as to not distract from the cele- bration of the sacrament.</p>
</div>

<h2>Picture and Videos</h2>
<div class="text-column2">
	<p>The family is welcome to take photos and video of the Baptism Liturgy for the purpose of recording this very special event in the life of the child to be baptized. We suggest that members of the family beside the parents and godparents, whose role is to actively participate in the liturgy, be designated to take the photos and/or video.</p>
	<p>Professional and private photographers hired by the family are welcome but must be made aware that their work must not disturb the liturgy or interfere with other people’s right to enjoy the ceremony. This is especially important for those participating in the Group Baptisms.</p>
</div>

<div class="separator"></div>

<blockquote>
	<p>The Church celebrates baptism as a joyful and prayerful experience for all who are involved. The celebration especially requires the active participation of the parents and godparents of the child who is being baptized. It is a sacred time that needs to be respected by all who are participating and witnessing.</p>
